AImages 1.0 is an innovative image generation tool powered by the DALLÂ·E 2 API model, which is an advanced AI model developed by OpenAI. This cutting-edge technology leverages the power of deep learning to create unique and visually compelling images based on text prompts. With AImages 1.0, you can generate a wide range of images by simply providing textual descriptions, making it a versatile and creative tool for various applications. You can generate image in three diferent ways.

 1. Prompt to image:
    
-just write your text in search section and click "Generate" button.

 2. Suprise me:
    
-click on the "Suprise me" to fill search section with random text and then "generate" button.

 3. Generate variation:
    
-click on the "upload an image" and choose a .png file from your computer. (image must be a 256 x 256 png file!)

**For now generated images are limited to 1 photo only because of OpenAi fees*

## FAQ

#### 1. How many photos can I generate for each query?

For now generated images are limited to 1 photo only because of OpenAi fees.

#### 2. Why uploading image is limited to 256px only? 

This restriction is imposed by OpenAi.

#### 3. Why layout is so ascetic?

Because i am not an Artist :)
