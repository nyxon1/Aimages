# AImages 1.0

AImages 1.0 is a prompt to image generator based on DALLE 2 API model. You can generate image in three diferent ways.

1. Prompt to image:
-just write your text in search section and click "Generate" button.

2. Suprise me:
-click on the "Suprise me" to fill search section with random text and then "generate" button.

3. Generate variation:
-click on the "uploand an image" and choose a .png file from your computer. (image must be a 256 x 256 png file!)

For now generated images are limited to 1 photo only because of OpenAi fees.

## FAQ

#### 1. How many photos can I generate for each query?

For now generated images are limited to 1 photo only because of OpenAi fees.

#### 2. Why uploading image is limited to 256px only? 

This restriction is imposed by OpenAi.

#### 3. Why layout is so ascetic?

Because i am not an Artist :)

## Optimizations

On branch "Typescript" i am working on migration from JS to TS. For now I have some conflict with Typescript versions in this project. For your safety use only the stable version on main branch.
